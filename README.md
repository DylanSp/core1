# core1
core1 is a small functional language, inspired by GHC Core and the simply typed lambda calculus, to be used as a target for compiling functional languages. 

core1 owes a great deal to Stephen Diehl's excellent [Write You a Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/index.html) tutorial; much of its code is borrowed or inspired by the languages developed in chapters 1-6 of WYaH.
